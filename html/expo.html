            Vincent Willem van Gogh was a Dutch post-impressionist painter who
            posthumously became one of the most famous and influential figures
            in the history of Western art. In a decade, he created about 2,100
            artworks, including around 860 oil paintings, most of which date
            from the last two years of his life. They include landscapes, still
            lifes, portraits and self-portraits, and are characterised by bold
            colours and dramatic, impulsive and expressive brushwork that
            contributed to the foundations of modern art. He was not
            commercially successful, and his suicide at thirty-seven came after
            years of depression and poverty.

            Van Gogh drew, and painted with watercolours while at school, but
            only a few examples survive and the authorship of some has been
            challenged. When he took up art as an adult, he began at an
            elementary level. In early 1882, his uncle, Cornelis Marinus, owner
            of a well-known gallery of contemporary art in Amsterdam, asked for
            drawings of The Hague. Van Gogh's work did not live up to
            expectations. Marinus offered a second commission, specifying the
            subject matter in detail, but was again disappointed with the
            result. Van Gogh persevered; he experimented with lighting in his
            studio using variable shutters and different drawing materials. For
            more than a year he worked on single figures – highly elaborate
            studies in black and white, which at the time gained him only
            criticism. Later, they were recognised as early masterpieces.
